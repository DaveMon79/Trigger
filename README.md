# Trigger

This application was created created in loving memory of Trigger the cat, who sadly passed away in November 2022.

Trigger was origanally found living on tram tracks in South Manchester by South Manchester Cat Rehoming charity, he was badly injured with multiple cuts over his body.

He was nursed back to health in a foster home, then found his forever home where he lived the rest of days as a happy cat.

We decided to create a website to give pet owners who are sadly unable to keep their pets, a dedicated platform to find their pet a safe and loving new home. We hope this website will stop countless pets being abandoned like Trigger was.
